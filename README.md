### Usinng **Python** for 5 years (today is 04/08/2025)

i just love programming and writing code, it helps take my mind off my routine, idk why

```python
class toilet:
    def poo(RelaxingLevel: int) -> str:
        '''python is my first programming language which im tried to learn ever'''
        if RelaxingLevel < 50:
            return "i like it actualy"
      	
        return "buy the way..."
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    RelaxingLevel = 0
    
    IsThatAutism = input("sometimes I can sit at the computer for 8 hours trying to write something worthwhile\nMaybe it an autism? $:")
    
    if IsThatAutism.lower() == "yes":
        RelaxingLevel += 42
        print(toilet.poo(RelaxingLevel))
    else:
        print("anyway, i think its not so bad for my life")
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "and im trying to lear a C++ too, cause its fast p.l." << std::endl;
    std::cout << "but i know this language not so good like Python" << std::endl;
    // bla-bla-bla
    return 0;
}
```
